## Introduction

In March 2023, we attended a Jane Street recruiting session for STEM focused Waterloo undergraduates. 
We noticed something subtle right as we entered the room: Jane Street recruiters signed us into the event, and they were all female. 
They were setting up the room, and organized the entire event which included food, puzzles, and social networking. 

Later on in the event, we had the opportunity to talk to full-time software engineers and quantitative traders who work at the company. 
But, in contrast to the group of women who greeted us at the entrance, this group of engineers was exclusively male. 

While this is just one personal anecdote, it aligns with an alarming reality of the one sided gender ratio in STEM fields such as Computer Science.

Take Computer Science. You're likely to notice an overwhelming percent of computer scientists are men. 
The 2022 Stack Overflow survey of over 70,000 software developers found that globally only 5.17% of [respondents were women](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022), 
an unnerving statistic for one of the most popular crowd-sourcing and learning sites related to software engineering. 
In the United States, the software publishing industry as a whole has a slightly better ratio with females making up 31% of the [workforce](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm). 

This disparity also exists in the education system. Let's demonstrate. 

<FullPageScroller Background={FemaleCounter}>
  <div>Consider a group of 100 post-secondary students.</div>
  <div>In 1970, 42 of them would have been women, on average.</div>
  <div>Today, women make up over half of the students.</div>
  <div>However, if we consider only STEM classes, this drops to 34%.</div>
  <div>Even worse, if this is a Computer Science class, we can expect as few as 20 women.</div>
